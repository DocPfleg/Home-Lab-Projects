- This will be the first of five projects, taken from Josh Madakor's YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9wz0Sted_I
  - This is the video of the actual tutorial that I am following: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoZeVbbZ0o0&list=PLqBeiU46hx1EfJnCI8pw_BTTtRsc4bgcV&index=47
  - I will be providing commentary and walk-thru as proof of completing this project.

- It will provide me with experience in the following:
  - Using custom PowerShell script to extract metadata from Windows Event Viewer to be forwarded to third party API in order to derive geolocation data
  - Configuring Log Analytics Workspace in Azure to ingest custom logs containing geographic information (latitude/longitude, state/province, and country)
  - Configuring custom fields in Log Analytics Workspace with the intent of mapping geo data in Azure Sentinel
  - Configuring the Azure Sentinel SIEM workbook to display global attack data (RDP brute force) on world map according to the physical location and magnitude of attacks.
