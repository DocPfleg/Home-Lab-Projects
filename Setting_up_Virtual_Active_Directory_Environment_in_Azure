- This will be the second of five projects taken from Josh Madakor's YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9wz0Sted_I
  - This is the video of the actual tutorial that I am following: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsI8hJmggI
  - I will be providing commentary and walk-thru as proof of completing this project.

- This will give me experience in the following areas:
  - Active Directory Administration
    - PowerShell: automated provisioning, maintaining, and deprovisioning of user accounts
  - Setting up Remote Access Server (RAS) features to support NAT/PAT
  - Implementation and maintenance of Windows DNS and DHCP servers
  - Configuration of Windows File Servers with implementation of quotas and NTFS permissions
