02/22/2022 - Today's Project: Setting up ParrotOS on VirtualBox

- Process is virtually the same (har har) as setting up Kali, but with an .iso file instead of an .ova file.

- Booted into the .iso just fine.

- Everything was going nice and smooth until I reached the install screen inside the VM. Installation hung at 68%.
     - Looks like the process running at the bottom of the install screen is /usr/bin/bootloader-config

- Deleted VM and started over.

- Ran into the same problem, again.
     - There's only one troubleshooting article on the ParrotOS site, and it has to do with getting the GRUB bootloader to play nice:
     - https://www.parrotsec.org/docs/troubleshooting-grub.html
     - Let's give it a try!

- Welp, that didn't work. Not sure what the holdup is. Not seeing any chatter about it on the interwebs. Will have to look into it more some other time.

- Time to install VMWare Workstation and see if I have more luck, there.

- First thoughts on VMWare: Seems more professional and full-featured, compared to VirtualBox.
     - After using only VirtualBox for a couple of months, I think I might like VMWare more, already.
     - For one thing, it seems WAY faster. Also, I was able to use way more GPU memory (up to 8GB?!)

- Success! VMWare for the win. It looked like it was going to hang at the same place (68%), but after a few minutes it jumped ahead and finished.

- This was fun. I might just use VMWare exclusively from now on...
     - Time to create a Kali VM and see if I like it better.
     - I was having a lot of trouble getting the most recent release of Kali to keep it's resolution settings in VirtualBox.
